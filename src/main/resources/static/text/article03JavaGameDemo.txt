[p]<#v,456#>One of my earlier Java Projects was creating a small 2D demo game.
Towards the end of my previous project, ##a console based bank statement conversion project, https://gabrielwright.xyz/article/201##, I realised that I had left considerations of my front end interaction with the conversion software until the end of the project.
This combined with the bank statement conversion project not being too inspiring in terms of content, affected my motivation. 

[p]For my next project I wanted to develop something that I would get immediate, tangible feedback from.
With game development, you are forced to figure out the interaction between back end game logic and front end visuals pretty early on. 
I also started working on ##Chaotic Cats,https://gabrielwright.xyz/article/301## at the same time. Developing a game demo from scratch would
support my understanding of interacting systems within game loops and engines in general.

[p]This Java game project I made was much more complex to develop compared to any minigame I have worked on for Chaotic Cats.
 With Chaotic Cats, Unity handles most of the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
 Therefore, in this article, I will focus less on the specifics of the game's content and instead
 provide an overview of the main game loop. This loop governs the update of game logic and rendering, ensuring smooth
 operation and visual representation. 

[p] <#h,My First Questions#>

At the outset of my project, I was confronted with two questions:
How do I ensure the game continuously updates, and how do I create a distinct window to display my game world? 
Unlike previous projects I've worked on, both personally and academically, where code executed only at program 
start or in response to user input via command line, games require constant code execution to update visuals 
on screen and handle background game logic.

[p] <#y,https://www.youtube.com/embed/om59cwR7psI?si=wXCnxpmsqlnBdQcZ#>I turned to online game loop tutorials in Java. The most common approach was to implement the Runnable interface within the main game class.
Within java, the Runnable interface allows any class instance to be executed by a specific thread. 
This run() method is called continuously by said specific thread. 
Threads in programming allow the developer to create separate paths of execution within a program, 
that can communicate with one another and allow for concurrent execution of tasks. 
By running the game loop in a separate thread, it allows the game to continuously update and render at the appropriate intervals. 

[p] <#c,
public class GamePanel extends JPanel implements Runnable {

        //Initialising game panel class

        public void startGameThread() {
            gameThread = new Thread(this);
            gameThread.start();
            lockCursorToCentre();
        }

       @Override
      public void run() {
            double timePerFrame = 1000000000.0 / FPS;
            double timePerUpdate = 1000000000.0 / UPS;

            long previousTime = System.nanoTime();        //checks time of activation of run method in nanoseconds
            long lastCheck = System.currentTimeMillis();   //checks time of activation of run method in milliseconds
            int updates = 0;
            int frames = 0;

            double deltaU = 0; // used for checking if Update ticks pass threshold of timePerUpdate
            double deltaF = 0; // used for checking if time has passed enough for a frame to update

            //Everytime deltaU threshold passes a certain value - enough time has passed for an update
            //Everytime deltaF threshold passes a certain value, enough time has passed for a new frame
                }
        }
#>


[p]This approach has some downsides and limitations regarding efficiency and concurrency.
With a single threaded implementation, the game operates on one thread, which can be inefficient,
especially when other parts of the program, such as input handling, rendering, and background tasks, could be running concurrently. 
A single threaded approach can also lead to blocking. If I were to make a more complex game, a single threaded approach may not provide the best
responsiveness. Multithreading, where different tasks run concurrently on different threads would be optimal in such cases.

[p]Despite the drawbacks, I chose to begin with the single threaded approach.
My university assignments in High Performance Computing with C++ gave me confidence in handling multithreading.
But I also understood from my HPC module that implementing multi threading would add extra complications,
such as synchronisation and race conditions. Given that the game demo I was creating was a very simple 2D game, I deemed multithreading overkill.
I felt that delving into multithreading might have diverted my focus from learning other essential concepts of game loop and software architecture creation, especially as I was just starting out.
Additionally, most online resources I found for 2D game development did not mention multithreading.


[p]<#c,public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
          super.paintComponent(g);
          checkFullScreenToggle();
          currentState.render(g);
       }
#>
In terms of rendering onto the screen, I ended up using JPanel. JPanel is a Swing component in Java, platform-independent,
used to create a container, essentially a window, on the screen that can represent other components like buttons, 
text fields, images, and more. It's commonly used for creating GUIs in Java applications.


[p]By extending the JPanel class, a paintComponent(Graphics g) method is called anytime the panel needs to be repainted.
Within paintComponent you can use the Graphics object to draw graphics to a panel.
Graphics object can be utilized to draw graphics to the panel. 
This includes drawing sprites, text from certain fonts, or generic shapes such as circles or rectangles.

[p] In my demo program, I structured different game states (e.g., menu, gameplay, game over) as objects within GameState objects.
These objects then delegate rendering tasks to various sub components within my architecture, such as the LevelManager and TaskRunner.


[p] <#c,

public abstract class State {

   public abstract void initialiseState();
   public abstract void reloadState();
   public abstract void update();
   public abstract void render(Graphics g);
}

public class GameState extends State{
	//..
    @Override
    public void update() {
       checkPauseState();
       levelManager.update();
       taskHandler.updateTasks();
    }

    @Override
    public void render(Graphics g) {
       levelManager.draw(g);
       gameUI.render(g);
    }
}
#>

[p]Additionally, within our update method, the repaint() method is called whenever an FPS update is required.
This triggers the paintComponent method to be called, refreshing the screen. 
This setup ensures smooth and continuous rendering of the game's visuals.

[p]<#h,Setting Milestones#>

[p] <#v,461#>With this project I did not start with a main gameplay conception, but merely a set of features I wanted to create for my gameplay loop:
a player character, a displayable map, a simple collision system, background events like ui and sound, loading/switching between gameStates i.e. navigating a menu, pausing etc.

[p]<#h,Entities, Levels and the interaction between the two#>

[p] To simplify development for this demo, I chose a tile based level system, similar to the approach I took for the maze game
I created in Chaotic Cats. A level in the game is defined as X tiles in width by Y tiles in height.
Each tile is represented by a Tile class I created.

[p]<#c,
public class Tile {


   // Leave as BufferedImage for now - in case of animated Tiles, create a separate class for this
   protected BufferedImage tileImage;
   protected boolean isSolid = false;


   public Tile(BufferedImage tileImage, boolean isSolid) {
       this.tileImage = tileImage;
       this.isSolid = isSolid;
   }

    //Getters & Setters ...
}#>

[p]<#l,457#>Every tile stores an image representing its appearance and a boolean indicating whether it’s solid, meaning entities cannot pass through it.
For my purposes, all tiles have the same properties except for solidity. 
I did have a small test before settling on a topdown view, where I made a platformer with tiles that had different
properties such as slanted tiles, though implementing the gravity proved problematic.
Instead of storing levels as 2D arrays of Tile objects, I represented them as 2D arrays of integers, with 
each integer corresponding to a specific tile template enumeration. This approach was chosen to save memory.

[p]<#c,public enum TileType {
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_RIGHT(0),
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_BOTTOM(1),
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_LEFT(2),
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_TOP(3),
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_TOP_RIGHT(4),
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_BOTTOM_RIGHT(5),
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_BOTTOM_LEFT(6),
   SOLID_WALL_EXPOSED_TOP_LEFT(7),
   SOLID_WALL_UNEXPOSED_RIGHT(8),
   SOLID_WALL_UNEXPOSED_BOTTOM(9),
   SOLID_WALL_UNEXPOSED_LEFT(10),
   SOLID_WALL_UNEXPOSED_TOP(11),
   SOLID_WALL(12),
   DEMITRANSPARENT(13),
   //Test level
   LIGHT_BLUE(0),
   GREY(1),
   PURPLE(2),
   TRANSPARENT(3);#>

[p]Entities, like the player or NPCs, continuously store their positions (x and y).
However, in order to support collision handling with both the level and other game objects, such as other entities, positional events, and items,
game objects are stored within a grid data structure. The concept behind this approach is ##Spatial Hash Mapping., https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/spatial-hashing-r2697/##

[p]<#r,458#>I developed features individually, creating the tile system to load levels and sprites, followed by the entity system.
Collision detection between the player object and solid tiles within the level was handled by passing the level's properties and 
tiles directly as an object to each player. When both of these systems were created, there was no greater architecture that cohesively linked the level tile based system
and the entities together. When considering collisions between game objects I discovered
the need to integrate the two systems together. My game has an update rate of 120 ticks per second. 
That means 120 times every second update will be called. If in the game state, this means iterating over each game object, checking 
for collisions, and updating game logic. If done linearly this could result in O(n^2) complexity for collision handling, each game object
comparing its collide state with every other game object.
A spatial hash map is a data structure that partitions the game world into cells, with each cell containing entities 
or objects located within it. By grouping entities into cells based on their positions, collisions only need to be 
checked between entities within the same or adjacent cells.

[p]Dividing the level into smaller sections and calculating collisions within each section significantly reduces the
number of collision checks. If we were to simply divide the map into 4 quadrant, this, in the best case scenario, 
simplifies the complexity of collision handling to O((n/4)^2).

[p] <#v,459#>Given that I already had a tile based system in place, integrating a spatial hash map based on this system seemed like a natural choice.
The grid-like structure of the tile system aligned well with the concept of partitioning the game world into cells. 
Each tile could act as a cell boundary, and entities within each cell could be efficiently managed using the existing grid structure.

[p]My GameObjectGrid stores all cells within a 2d map, effectively allowing efficient lookup and scalability.
This spatial hashmap system also extended comfortably to my entity pathfinding. 
In game development it is common to group entities together, especially if they follow similar paths. 
Having entities and game objects assigned to specific tiles/cells is ideal for this.

[p]A* pathfinding is an algorithm used for  finding smooth, optimal, and believable navigation for game characters and entities.
In my game A* pathfinding calculates paths between the player cells and associated entity group cells. 
For each cell containing an entity, the next step for heading towards the player is stored, and this process continues until 
the target is reached. 

[p]While this approach provides a natural way to handle pathfinding within my grid based system,
there's room for improvement in future iterations. Grouping entities into cells improves performance compared to 
calculating each entity individually but the cells are usually too small a space to contain multiple enemies. 
To address this, I could explore implementing hierarchical pathfinding, which involves dividing the map into larger regions 
for broader pathfinding calculations. Or alternatively a leader/follower method could be employed if entities spawn in similar
locations and have the same end destination.

[p]<#h,Background Tasks#>

I knew early on that I would need to have a separate piece of architecture handling background tasks. 
Examples of  background tasks  include: spawning game objects, tracking game timers, playing sounds or UI prompts.
To handle these tasks effectively for my demo I developed a robust background task handler.

[p] At the core of this system is the TaskRunner class, which acts as a conductor, managing the execution of various tasks.
The TaskRunner maintains two lists: 'activeTasks' for tasks that are currently running and 'queuedTasks' for tasks waiting to be executed.

[p]<#c,
public abstract class Task {
        //Flag for if task complete
        protected boolean complete = false;

        public abstract void runTask();

        //Getters & Setters...
}
#>

[p]Tasks are represented by objects of the abstract Task class, which defines essential properties and methods for tasks.
Each task needs to be able to be completed and updated. If a task is time-related, it has an associated tick integer that is updated every 
time the updateTask() method is called. This task handler provides a structured approach to managing various background tasks in the game. 
For example, to spawn entities, trigger timers, play sounds, or show UI prompts, I simply create instances of the corresponding task 
classes and add them to the TaskRunner. 

[p]As I crept closer towards my milestones, I decided to create a score based arcade demo involving enemies and events spawning indefinitely.
 To accomplish this, I developed a "Wave" task responsible for loading and selecting these events and tasks.
 
In the next section I will attempt to link together the pieces of my software architecture that I have mentioned so far.

[p]<#h, Example from States to Wave Task#>

When the game starts, it boots into the main menu, represented by the ‘MenuState’ class:

[p]<#c, public class MenuState extends State{
	
    //… instantiating constants for menu

    @Override
    public void initialiseState() {
       menuConstants.loadMainMenu(soundSettings, scoreReader);
       menuNavigator = new MenuNavigator("TEST", menuConstants.getRootMain());
       menuRenderer = new MenuListRenderer(menuNavigator);
       menuRenderer.loadMenuScaling();
       lockCursor();
   }
}
#>

[p]From the main menu, when the player starts the game, the GameState is initialised based on the selected level's ID.
The level is initialised using this ID, and a random seed for this round is generated:


[p]<#c,
    private void loadLevelManager(int levelID) {
       levelManager = new LevelManager();
       level = levelID;
       levelManager.loadNewLevel(level);
    }
    private void loadRandomiser() {
       seedRandomiser = new Random();
       gameSeed = seedRandomiser.nextInt();
    }
    private void loadWaveManager(int waveRound, int wavePoints) {
       waveManager = new WaveManager(waveRound, wavePoints, gameSeed);
       waveManager.loadRandomGenerators();
       waveManager.loadSpawnConstants(level);
       TaskRunner.addTask(waveManager);
#>

[p]Using the newly initialised level, a new wave spawn task is initialised and added to the background TaskRunner.
From here, every update, the LevelManager is updated, which contains the GameObjectHandler and updates all game objects therein,
and the TaskRunner is updated:

[p] <#c,
        @Override
            public void update() {
            checkPauseState();
            levelManager.update();
            taskHandler.updateTasks();
        }
    #>


[p]The wave task uses an integer tick, which is incremented every time the TaskRunner
UpdateTasks() method is called, to track how much time has passed.


[p]<#y, https://www.youtube.com/embed/7T-MTo8Uaio?si=132C00xMgjy8SBGk#>
In my demo, I used a shop based wave approach. Each wave has a certain number of points, and each possible spawn
(e.g., spawn a bomb, spawn entities) has an associated cost (number of waypoints it will take) and enforced cooldown 
of ticks before the next spawn. The intention was to make spawns worth more points less likely and include rarer spawns 
that would significantly change gameplay. However, for the prototype, I simplified this to randomly selecting events from 
available options for each level.

[p] Once there are fewer than 0 wave points, and all active spawn events are handled, the next round is triggered.
I considered recursively creating a new WaveManager object for this, but decided against it because the newly 
instantiated Wave class would need to be passed the previous wave's spawn constants based on the specific level.

[p]<#h,Reflections#>

In working on this project, I focused on developing specific gameplay elements, such as the tile based level system
and entity behaviours, before considering how to link these systems together.
This was good for experimentation but, again similar to my other projects, did lead to refactoring. 
Before settling on top down 2d games I even started different repos a few times.

[p]<#l,460#>The demo I made does have bugs and definitely does not play as smoothly as any of my minigames in Chaotic Cats.
I focused much more on the game loop than the mechanics, and while this is definitely still playable and fun if you know how to play, 
it isn’t ideal. There is a cliche online of aspiring game devs being stuck in game engine design hell, and I can definitely see how that 
is possible. But it was still invaluable to me to have worked to define my own. 
From what I see online, most AAA studios build upon their previously designed in house engines. 
There are areas of improvement, such as refining the pathfinding system and implementing more flexible events and wave spawns, 
but I intend in the future to build something in a new way from what i’ve learnt, maybe in 3d or with a new language like C++, 
implement some multithreading. 

[p]The whole process deepened my appreciation for the quality of games I get to enjoy. I worked solo on this project,
imagine the extra complexities of working in a huge studio team. It's an entirely different level being part of a team where 
developers build upon the core codebase. Development is not just about creating scientific systems; it's about considering 
real world use for those systems by other collaborators as well. With the rest of Headbounce, the team I am working with to create
Chaotic Cats, I get amateur experience with that. I look forward to having professional experience as a Software Developer.
